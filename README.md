## Design 

### Wireframe
The first thing i drew up was a very rough wireframe to get a feel for the base layout. I didnt want to do much with the wireframe as I wanted to see what felt right as I went on with the project.

### Color Palette

The color pallette I used was generated from a picture of croke park which is the header image on the home page. The colors generated can be seen below.

### Fonts

The fonts I used for this project are 'Oxygen' for the body and 'Prompt' for page title.


### Database Schema
To create my back-end database I have used ElephantSQL. I have designed my database using [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/), this is a free-to-use software however quite limited, as some fields didnâ€™t allow me to overwrite them, such as image fields. To help with the authentication Django has a built-in user Model Allauth which helps save time creating my own Model.

I have created three models for this project Post Model, Comment Model and the Contact Us Model.

## Features

### Home Page
When you enter the site for the first time you are greeted with a header image of the home of the GAA (Croke Park). Within the image there is some text to give a first time user a clear view as to what the blog is about. 
![Home page](media/images/home%20page%20header.jpg)

### Navbar
There is a very clear navbar which sticks to the top of the page so is always available for use. The navbar changes depending on whether the user has logged in or not. If not logged in a user will have the option to register(if they dont already have an account) or to login. If the user has logged in then they can add a post direct from the navbar or logout of there account.

## Testing

Testing was done throughout the development of this site through trial and error with Google Dev tools. Testing and code validation can be found in the following [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

***

## Deployment
 
To deploy your own project through Heroku follow the below steps:

* Sign Up/ Log In to Heroku
* On the Dashboard page select 'New' and the 'Create New App'.
* Provide your new app a suitable name which is unique as it cant be in use already, and select the region.


* I used [ElephantSql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) for my database.
* Create your ElephantSql account.
* Then navigate to the 'Create New Instance' tab.
* Name your database and select 'Tiny Turtle' in the 'plan' dropdown as it is the free option.
* Hit the 'Select region' button to continue.
* From the 'Data center' dropdown select the option which is closest to your region.
* Hit the 'review' button to review your plan and if its all good then hit 'create instance' to create your database.


* Within the repository in GitPod create a new file called env.py - within this file import the os library and set the environment variable for the DATABASE_URL ElephantSQL.
* Add a secret key to the app using os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key goes here". Add the secret key just created to the Heroku Config Vars as SECRET_KEY as the key and "your secret key" as the value.
* In the settings.py file within the django app, import Path from pathlib, import os and import dj_database_url insert the line if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env remove the insecure secret key with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') replace the databases section with DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}.
* In the terminal migrate the models over to the new database and sign up/log in to cloudinary.
* In cloudinary copy the CLOUDINARY_URL to the clipboard and paste this into the env.py as follows: os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "Url copied here".
* In Heroku, add the CLOUDINARY_URL and value copied from the clipboard to the config vars in settings. Also add the KEY - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with the Value - "1". (This must be removed prior to final deployment)
* Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps just above above 'django.contrib.staitcfiles' and cloudinary goes below.
* In the Settings.py file - add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]
* Heroku needs to be added to the allowed_hosts list followed by 'localhost'.
* Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile. Within this file ensure the following code is added: web: guincorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
* Ensure ALL changes have been added, committed and pushed to GitHub.
* Return to Heroku and look for the deployment tab. Click Deploy branch manually (this can be changed to automatic at later date).
* If there are no build log errors you should see a notification advising ' Your App was successfully deployed' with a link to the live site.

```
Go to "Settings" then "Config Vars" and click the button "Reveal Config Vars". 
Make sure your Config Vars look as follows:

    * DATABASE_URL - (will be copied from ElephantSql)
    * SECRET_KEY - (this is what ever value you gave it in settings.py)
    * CLOUDINARY_URL - (copy the URL from your account on Cloudinary) 
    * DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC - (1)
    * PORT - (8000)
```
